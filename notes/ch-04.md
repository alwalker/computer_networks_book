MAC -> Medium Access Control. Blend of layer 1 and layer 2 that coordinates "channels" and more effecient use of physical layer

MACA -> It's crazy that wifi not being able to broadcast to an entire network is one of the things that makes it so complex

Ethernet also has back off capabilities but is purely time based

Switched ethernet is awesome

Ethernet is both a layer 1 and 2 protocol but the clear delination in the spec is why it has lasted for so long

802.11a|b|g were all in the same spectrum. N was a big deal

Lots of "pre back offs" and ack'ing can explain why crowded wifi is slow

Ethernet really doesn't have the "how does this not catch fire constantly" feel that OS stuff did

Buffering/Traffic Maps/Beaconing/Sleeping make wifi pretty cool

Ethernet switchs = bridges

Transport Gateway -> bridge layer 4 protocols

Gateways bridge different same layer protocols
