Things are ordered in both data and transport layers

"Wire speed" -> layer 2 shoving frames out as fast as layer 1 can allow and letting layer 3 deal with it

Feedback Control -> Send burst of frames then wait for reestablish physical connection. (Wifi)

So many algorithms written 40+ years before they could be useful. Really highlights value of academia

Known hardware limits/failure points + known capacity of error handling/codes + estimated burst capability from layer 1 = big wins

ACK/NACK not just for coordination but also a great way to sneak frames back and forth

Bigger frames equal better utilization of physical layer but require more memory. Probably worh it in data heavy applications

Re: network example C code -> this is why we have syntactic sugar

SONET/PPP frame negotiation looks more like HL7
