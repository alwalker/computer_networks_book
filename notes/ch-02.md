Guided transmission = wires
Storage capacity gains are STILL out pacing network
CAT8 cables are strikingly similar to stuff IBM was doing decades ago...
"coax" = 6GHz of bandwidth and average TV channel only uses 3.5MHz
X10 => power line networking before LANs
The internet of things is philisophically the opposite of a contend delivery network
Fiber = 30k GHz
Funny metrics: A foot is a light nanosecond and Tremendously High Frequency
"Unguided optical communications" => Using the cameras and screens we already have to transmit/recieve digital signals
symbol = number of bits in a transmission; baud = symbolds/second
T1 messages could have no more than 15 zeroes or they couldn't figure out boundries
The original killer packet was sending too many zeros
Digital signals need to be less accurate to capture information and thus are cheaper and more information can be transmitted in the same "space"
Up vs Down is a matter of both people downloading more than uploading and also fitting data traffic into existing bandwidths. By choice in xDSL by need in Cable
2G was 13kbps no wonder it sounded bad
So many 4G standards
5G network slicing/vlans => how we got free netflix
Cable upload speed is bad because it fits on the much smaller lower end of the spectrum of the cable before TV while download has all the room after
DOCSIS minislots => timing and why upload is even more bad
Iridium and others existed before Starlink but also before really feasible large scale
Book calls the relation between satalites and fiber perfectly
Both telephone and cable networks all are fiber outside "the last mile"
Cable is suffering because unlike telephone "the last mile" is shared space
