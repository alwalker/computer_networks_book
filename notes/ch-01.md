Transit networks gave way to content networks and big companies

Home networks being referred to as organic as an opposition to company ones being planned...lol

"Metropolitan Area Network"

Pre ARPA: Baran and lol AT&T

Subnets used to have a different meaning

Both the US and EU privatized

The internet exists because AT&T wouldn't build it

Seeing Twitch mentioned in a text book is strange

4G is the first fully packet switched cell network...why?/counterpoint to content based networks

The sassy remarks abotu wifi sound personal

"nomadic" is a great word for just moving from desk to desk

lookup `internetworking`

"Service Primitives" made me glad I started with the OS book

lookup Apocalypse of the Two Elephants 

TCP/IP came before OSI

I like the reasoning behind the book using the hybrid model

A standard is only "what is needed for interop"

2016 and fake news
