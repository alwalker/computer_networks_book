there's really not much connectionless about the internet

Proofs by contradiction!

No dialtone is a form of admission control

Reoccuring theme of dealing with response times not load/bandwidth/etc

Leaky buckets weren't what I thought of when I first heard traffic shaping

RED => random early detection => queue length exceeds threshold => drop a random packet => random means high chance busiest route

ECN => Explicit Choice Notification => mark packets as part of congested

QoS/Differentieated services => treat things differently 

Overlay => network of tunnels "over" another network

Packet fragmenting reminds me of the HL7 problem

SIPP => Simple Internet Protocol Plus => IPv6

Learning about ARP before DHCP is way better than the reverse...*cough* top down learning *cough cough*

SDN does not mean what I think it does

AWS Security Groups are connection oriented 

ARP makes VIPs make sense!!
