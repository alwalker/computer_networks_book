Was actually modeled after OSI

Started out based on something from Xerox

Started out on coax but didn't want to use ethernet because connectors were expensive

Moved to ADB with everything else

Initially 230kbps over 300 meters up to 32 nodes

LocalTalk -> layer 1

Decentralized, everything was autonegotiated on hookup

EtherTalk -> LocalTalk over ethernet

AppleShare -> file server

Initially ethernet hardware was all 3rd party as they thought no one wanted it

G3 machines had 10BaseT

Stanford Ethernet and Columbia Applatalk were early gateways

Naming actually covered the node and the port. Was called a service

Had both datagram (DDP) and "guaranteed" (ADP)

Initially went VERY well, but ethernet gear got cheaper and after switching couldn't keep up with other TCP/IP based solution
